# teamR-HopDrop
Goal for Sprint 1:
We wanted to complete all the navigational elements, and things pertaining to the UI, while only using Firebase for the login and to populate the profile. We are putting everything in place so that for Sprint 2, we may use information from Firebase instead of pre-populated data.

What we have completed this sprint:
- Created a log in page with firebase authentication (jhed and password) with error prevention
- Created the main activity with fragments for "Home", "Orders", and "Accounts".
- For "Home": 
  - We created the tab layout with the current orders and deliveries
  - It currently is NOT with real deliviers, it is pre populated (ie. hardcoded), the implementation is detailed and planned in our sprint 2
