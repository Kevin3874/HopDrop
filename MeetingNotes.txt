Title: Wendesday In-class Meeting
Date: April 5th
  Working meeting:
    1) Decided that for the home page and the profile page, it would be better to implement the orders and deliveries in tabs instead of table style
      Reasons:
        - Easier navigation
        - Less crowded (Orders can go across the whole screen)
    2) Asked Prof. Selinski about how to implement tabs
    3) Tab Layout implemented using Viewpager2
    
  Current status:
    - The orders are pre-populated from a list but tabs exist in each fragment
  Need to do:
    1) Current orders are pre-populated upon creation
        - Sprint 2
    2) FAB on home page no longer showing

--------------------------------------------------

Title: Meeting with John, go over implementation
Date: April 16th
  Met with our TA, John, to confirm some changes we should make:
    1) Home page New order button design improvements
      - Instead of having it in the corner where the color is similar to the order cards, maybe make it a darker color (flip the existing colors
      - Instead of the details button, add a Info (i) icon in the top right corner
        - Should be intuitive enough for people to know to press it for more details
    2) Retrieving orders from firebase
      - Orders currently being added with the fields in a map
        - Changed it to be added as an order object
      - Problem: When adding orders from Firestore into a list, the function is returning faster than the list can be updated so it’s returning an empty list
        - Solution: Take a look at the slides to add a data changed listener which will wait until the data is updated before returning
            - Day17 slides
            - Look at recycler view example
            
    Divided some tasks:
      What we need to do:
      - Image for profile - Kevin
      - Add an image for delivery - Ehong
      - Make QR code pages - Ehong
      - Update firestore when the order is accepted and remove from orders and add it under userId Current delieveries in firebase- Joey
      - Update past orders and deliveries - Vivian
      - Update the card design for home page - Joey
      - Update the states and progress bar - Vivian
      Bug to fix
      - Clicking back, the delivered button doesn’t go to next page or update progress bar anymore

--------------------------------------------------------------
