Title: Wendesday In-class Meeting
Date: April 5th
  Working meeting:
    1) Decided that for the home page and the profile page, it would be better to implement the orders and deliveries in tabs instead of table style
      Reasons:
        - Easier navigation
        - Less crowded (Orders can go across the whole screen)
    2) Asked Prof. Selinski about how to implement tabs
    3) Tab Layout implemented using Viewpager2
    
  Current status:
    - The orders are pre-populated from a list but tabs exist in each fragment
  Need to do:
    1) Current orders are pre-populated upon creation
        - Sprint 2
    2) FAB on home page no longer showing

--------------------------------------------------

  Tasks Remaining to Clean Up Sprint 1:
    1) Deliverer picked up and delivered screen

    3) Fix FAB on home page - can’t see it at the moment
    4) Password as dots default
